# Contributing

I am pretty new to this so I just used a CONTRIBUTING template found here on GitHub because I really like how it states what I have in mind.
However I might modify it in the future.

I welcome all the contributions to my project (GUI, backend, features, etc.), just discuss them with the contributors of
the project via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct. Follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

If you want to modify the code, suggest a new feature feel free to send a pull request by just following these steps:

1. Ensure you have all the required dependencies.
2. Make a pull request explaining your changes.
